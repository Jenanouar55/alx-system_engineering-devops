# Postmortem: The Case of the Nginx Misadventure 🕵️‍♂️
## Issue Summary
### Duration:
August 16, 2024, 08:00 AM - 09:30 AM UTC (1 hour 30 minutes).

### Impact:
75% of our users experienced frustratingly slow response times or were outright denied access to our beloved web application. Our primary website and API endpoints were caught in the chaos, leaving users stranded in a virtual no-man’s-land. In total, about 75% of our users were affected, leading to a significant drop in service availability.

### Root Cause:
An unexpected configuration hiccup in our trusty Nginx web server turned out to be the villain of the hour. The misconfigured server block was the digital equivalent of a "Do Not Enter" sign, effectively cutting off user access.

### Timeline
08:00 AM: Monitoring tools screamed for attention as error rates skyrocketed. On-call engineer grabbed coffee and braced for impact.
08:05 AM: Engineer attempted to access the website, only to be met with a spinning wheel of doom. Timeouts confirmed the worst.
08:10 AM: Initial investigation kicked off, focusing on the application server. Assumption: "Must be the database acting up again!"
08:20 AM: After thoroughly interrogating the database and application logs, nothing suspicious was found. The plot thickened.
08:35 AM: Nginx logs revealed themselves as the real suspects. Misconfigurations in the server block were like breadcrumbs leading to the problem.
08:40 AM: Incident was escalated to the DevOps team, who quickly rolled up their sleeves.
09:00 AM: DevOps team identified the faulty configuration, corrected it, and gave Nginx the good old restart it needed.
09:15 AM: Monitoring tools showed signs of life! Users started to trickle back in as the site began to recover.
09:30 AM: The incident was officially resolved, and the team collectively sighed in relief. Postmortem scheduled with promises of donuts.
Root Cause and Resolution
Root Cause:
The root cause was a simple yet dastardly misconfiguration in the Nginx server block that slipped through our deployment process. The specific directive was incorrectly set, causing Nginx to mishandle incoming HTTP requests. This created a bottleneck, leaving users unable to reach our services.

### Resolution:
The issue was resolved by carefully inspecting the Nginx configuration, identifying the incorrect setting, and promptly correcting it. Once the configuration was fixed, a restart of the Nginx service brought the web server back to its full operational glory.

# Corrective and Preventative Measures
### Improvements/Fixes:

Test Your Configurations: Let’s be honest, we’ve all been guilty of rushing a deployment. It’s time to slow down and give our configurations the attention they deserve.
Automate the Boring Stuff: Implement automated configuration checks to catch these pesky errors before they hit production.
Cross-Check Everything: A second pair of eyes (or two) can catch what the first pair missed. We’ll be enforcing stricter reviews on critical service configurations.
Task List:

[ ] Patch the Nginx server configuration to prevent future mishaps.
[ ] Add detailed monitoring for Nginx configurations to catch issues early.
[ ] Develop and deploy automated tests for configuration files in our CI/CD pipeline.
[ ] Organize a team training on Nginx configuration best practices (with donuts as an incentive).
### *Diagram Idea* 💡
Include a simple flowchart or diagram showing the sequence of events:
"User -> Load Balancer -> Nginx -> (Oh no!) Misconfiguration -> Error"

This visual will help readers quickly grasp the issue while adding a bit of flair to the postmortem.

With a touch of humor and a clear action plan, this postmortem not only addresses the issue but also engages the team in a way that makes them want to read—and act on—it.
